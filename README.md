"There arenâ€™t really any development fields more challenging than operating system (OS) development. It is the "great pinnacle of programming". Few programmers ever attempt to build an OS and many of those who do make the attempt never produce a functioning system. However, if you do make it all the way to the finish line and produce a functional operating system, you will have joined an elite group of top-flight programmers."

This quote I found on a random website is what really inspired me to get into the area of operating systems engineering (and the fact that I love a good challenge and have always preferred to stay on the low-level end of things, as it is the only real way to truly understand how everything works and become a world-class developer). Ever since, I have been actively learning, watching, reading about and doing tutorials on OS dev and all the subfields it entails in an attempt to one day reach a point of having gathered enough knowledge and skill to really become an esteemed world-class software engineer.

I am currently working at IBM developing z/OS, an operating system for running the world's mission critical applications.
